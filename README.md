# StatsAndBooze
StatsandBooze is an R-package developed to handle any type of data sets where Dates and Times are needed to be observed.  It can be used to find the suitable date for Happy Hours with the given data set. It can be used for the extension of "parse_dates" function, so that we can use the time intervals instead of single dates. This package allows us to make the specification of weekdays instead of the numerical data.
